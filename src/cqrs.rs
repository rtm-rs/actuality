/// In [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) we require that
/// changes are made only after loading the entire `Aggregate` in order to ensure that the full
/// context is understood.
/// With event-sourcing this means:
/// 1. Loading all previous events for the aggregate instance.
/// 1. Applying these events, in order, to a new `Aggregate` in order to reach the correct state.
/// 1. Using the recreated `Aggregate` to handle an inbound `Command` producing events or an error
/// (see `handle` method in this trait).
/// 1. Persisting any generated events or roll back in the event of an error.
///
/// To manage these tasks we use a `Cqrs`.
